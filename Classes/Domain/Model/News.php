 * extbase doctrine - MUST match to the news_relations field
 * that extends tx_news_domain_model_news for this entity type.
 * Why not just the field relations? BECAUSE $eventRelations
 * of the Event Model extend precisely the same table (with the
 * field "event_relations"). If the field was jus called "relations"
 * it would not be possible to differentiate between relations
 * to news and relations to events.
