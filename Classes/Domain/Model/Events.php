/**
 * An event in the research domain (like a conference, workshop,
 * hackathon etc.)
 *
 * NOTE: We CAN NOT use the RelationsTrait. The relations
 * property MUST be called $eventRelations as it - according to
 * extbase doctrine - MUST match to the event_relations field
 * that extends tx_news_domain_model_news for this entity type.
 * Why not just the field relations? BECAUSE $newsRelations
 * of the NEws Model extend precisely the same table (with the
 * field "news_relations"). If the field was jus called "relations"
 * it would not be possible to differentiate between relations
 * to events and relations to news.
